## R Markdown
# Intro

Today we are using penguin data learning markdown

# Load Libraries 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(kableExtra)
```

# Inspect the Data
```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

# Make a plot
```{r penguin1, fig.width=3, fig.height=4, fig.asp=1.2, fig.align='center', fig.cap="This is a plot of penguins"}
penguins %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, 
             y = bill_depth_mm,
             color = species)) + 
  geom_point() 
```

# Make a table
```{r}
penguins%>%
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise(billmean = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_classic() %>% 
  row_spec(2, bold = T, color = "white", background = "red")
```



This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
